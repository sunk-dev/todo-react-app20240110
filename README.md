# 리액트 프로젝트 시작하기

1. nodejs 설치
2. create-react-app 설치 (최초1번)
```
$ npm install -g create-react-app
```

3. react프로젝트 생성
```
$ npx create-react-app 프로젝트이름
```

4. react 프로젝트 실행
```
$ cd 프로젝트폴더
$ npm start
```
- http://localhost:3000 에서 프론트엔드 서버 실행


## git clone시 주의사항
- `$ npm install` 명령을 터미널에서 실행하여 라이브러리 설치


5. 추가 라이브러리
```
$ npm install react-icons  // 아이콘
$ npm install classnames   // 클래스 add/remove 편리한거
$ npm install sass // scss 문법 사용
$ npm install reactstrap bootstrap
$ npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
$ npm install @mui/icons-material
$ npm install react-router-dom
```

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
